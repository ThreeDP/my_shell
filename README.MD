# Sobre o Projeto
> The goal of this project is to create a shell using the Go programming language, which is a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with an operating system. The project will involve implementing basic functionality such as reading and interpreting commands, managing directories, manipulating environment variables, input/output redirection, pipelines, and executing built-in commands like echo and cd.
